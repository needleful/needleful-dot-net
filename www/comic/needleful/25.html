						<p class="nr">This comic is actually 14 Valentine's Day cards.  They all have empty "to" and "from" fields unless otherwise noted.</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: An apple with a realistic human face.  He's smiling warmly at us.</p><p class="dia">Caption: Lookin' Fine, Valentine!</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: A balding man at a chalkboard with a piece of chalk.</p><p class="dia">Caption: (in big, hand-written font on the chalkboard) Will you be my Valentine?  (In smaller text, written in perfect Times New Roman) <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">If not, you are required to write a five-page paper in MLA format explaining why I am not a suitable Valentine Candidate.  You must cite at least three credible sources for full credit</span></p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: A terribly compressed jpeg of santa and his elf with a blue heart added there too.</p><p class="dia">Caption: Merry Valentine's Day! (christmas is poorly crossed out with black)</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: An anthromorphic cat pirate is on a ship looking at us.  He has an eyepatch and a fresh bandage on his arm.  He's holding a piece of paper.</p><p class="dia">Caption: Yo-ho, captain!  I made ye a <em>Valentine!</em></p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: The paper the cat had was a piece of a Valentine's card, now being held in the viewer's hand.  It was a drawing of the cat and the captain, but it was ripped apart, and a message is written in a red fluid.</p><p class="dia">Caption: <em>Kill me it ins</em> (the message trails off the paper).  From: Me.  To: Captain.</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: The captain has lowered the note.  The cat looks at him, smiling.  The bandage on his arm is bleeding.</p><p class="dia">Caption: Yar har har!  'Twas all but an epic prank, Captain!  No need to look so shook!</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: The apple from before, but slightly different.  He has no eyebrows, and looks less charming and more creepy</p><p class="dia">Caption: Ahoy, Valentine! (I don't actually sail, I'm just having a bit of fun!) You are looking quite fine today!</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: A robot with a laptop for a head and a buff, extremely reflective body is posing seductively on a neon backdrop.</p><p class="dia">Caption: <em>My sense of self may be an illusion, but my love for you is also an illusion!</em></p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: A woman with a shaved head is lying on a table, eyes open.  One of the eyes has been pulled out by a surgeon, who is sticthing her lower eyelid.  Here pupils are in the shape of crosses.</p><p class="dia">Caption: You were made to be my valentine.</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: A Windows 10 blue screen of death, but in front of it are three characters.  One is a disembodied torso of an androgynous person.  Their chest is opened, revealing a ribcage and musckes.  Their blood is a dark purple or black.  To either side are little chibi characters.  One is staring smugly with a scapel, and the other is frowning, with arms crossed, apparently upset with the other.</p><p class="dia">Caption: (the text of the blue screen is partly blocked) The program "waifu.exe" ha... error and needs t... We are sorry for the inco...</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: The entire frame is muscle fibers connected erratically.  Bundles of muscle go in parallel lines.  In the center is a pair of yellow eyes.  Black, oily fluid is coming out of their eyes.</p><p class="dia">				Caption:

			</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: The apple is back.  He's right up in front of us.  Something is wrong with the lights.  He's a deep red.</p><p class="dia">Caption: what a fine valentine you are...  so very.... very... fine</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: The card is black.  The to and from lines, in white, extend to the edge of the card.  There are several white lines underneath them, converging near the bottom.</p><p class="dia">(No caption)</p><br><p class="nr">Pictured: A pixel lady is posing topless.  Her boobs are censored with video game coins.  A small triforce is behind her. A pixel heart is in front of her.</p><p class="dia">Caption: I'd <em>grind</em> all day, if it was on you ;)</p><p class="dia">Watermark: More EPIC GAMER CONTENT @ http://epic-gamer-content.xyz</p>
