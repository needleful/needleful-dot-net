It splits open like an apple, revealing a tiny pink lady.</p><p class="dia">Pink Lady: I am born.</p><p class="dia">Lee: Will you be my girlfriend?</p><p class="dia">Pink Lady: Creating a sentient lifeform just to trick it into being your girlfriend is exactly why you don't have a girlfriend.</p><p class="dia">Lee: Please don't bully me.</p><p class="dia">Pink lady: lmao I most definitely will.</p>
