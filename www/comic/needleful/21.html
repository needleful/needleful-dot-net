					<p>Some people found this comic confusing, so here's some clarification: while the entity in this comic is referred to as "God", it is actually based on a dream I had where I died and this is what I looked like as an angel.  It was some sort of co-op situation where everybody was their own god.  Also my older brother Dr. Manhattan was there, and he also looked like this, and I thought that was a clever and subtle metaphor for his godlike power as depicted in the comic <i>Watchmen</i>.  And then I noclipped around my childhood home and felt true euphoria, realizing heaven was being home with my family, having all the time in the world.</p><p>And then I woke up.  I go back to my old home and it's just an empty house.</p><p>I wish I believed in God and heaven.  I wish I could go to sleep knowing someday I would come back home forever.</p><br><p>Hopefully this answers any questions about the comic.</p>
