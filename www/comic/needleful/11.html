        <p>TRANSCRIPT:</p>
						<p class="nr">An astronaut is staring out at the surface of a moon.  At his feet are his footprints in the sand, and to his right is a flag that he apparently planted.

				There is nothing out on the horizon.  The sky is a deep black with nothing but the sun shining through.

				The astronaut crouches down and picks up some sand and gravel.

				He stares at it, then turns his hand and lets it fall off.

				He stands there, as we move further out to see more of the environment.

				He's about twenty feet from a moon lander.  His footprints lead from the moon lander and in a small circle around where he's standing now.

				There is nothing but sand and gravel for miles around.

				The astronaut just stands there.
