					<p>Well, here it is.  The last comic.  Then I disappeared for nearly three years.  Not much of a climactic conclusion.</p><p>On Tapas, I made a post saying the comic was ending because I was bored of it.  But that's a lie.  I was afraid of it.  I wasn't getting the validation and attention I was hoping for, and I was getting invested in the comic to the point it was harming my mental health.  I would spend hours just refreshing my metrics for new pages.  I would research when to post to different social media sites to maximize engagement. </p><p>It wasn't healthy, but to say I quit for my health would be generous.  I was just afraid I would spend a lot of effort on something that wouldn't pay off.  But it <em>did</em> pay off.  I haven't made any money off this, but I made things I'm proud of.  I'd like to make more things I'm proud of.</p>
