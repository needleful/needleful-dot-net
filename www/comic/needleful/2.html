        <p>TRANSCRIPT:</p>
						<p class="nr">A big man, named Tyler, is talking to a smaller man, Lee. Tyler is standing next to a skeleton.</p><p class="dia">Tyler: Hello, friend! Have you met my new skeleton?</p><p class="nr">Tyler has his hand on a skeleton's shoulder. The skeleton does not have any expression because it has a skull face.</p><p class="dia">Lee: His sternum looks like a necktie and I love him</p><p class="dia">Tyler: Thank you! I value your opinion because you are my friend.</p><p class="nr">Later.</p><p class="dia">Lee (to himself): I HATE Tyler and his skeleton! Now I have two skeletons and am much cooler than him.</p><p class="nr">Lee has a big skeleton and a little skeleton. The big one is slackjawed and looks happy. The little one has a big bow on its head and is hissing.</p><p class="dia">Unknown voice: Are those skeletons?</p><p class="nr">Lee is confused.</p><p class="nr">The unknown voice is a girl who has two skeletons.</p><p class="dia">Girl: I saw you had skeletons. Aren't they lovely?</p><p class="dia">Lee: Uh...</p><p class="dia">Suited Man: Are those skeletons? I just got my third one!</p><p class="nr">He is walking towards them with his three skeletons.</p><p class="nr">Suited man and girl start talking about skeletons. Girl's skeletons are both wearing blindfolds. Suited man has a little skeleton with devil horns peeking at us over his shoulder, and another in front of him pointing to its open mouth. The third one is not shown, because there are already too many skeletons and the frame is very crowded. Lee is standing by, unhappy. Lee's big skeleton is knawing on his head, and the little one is ready to pounce.</p><p class="dia">Lee: Oh no... If <em>everyone</em> has skeletons, that means... They are no longer <em>cool</em>! They're ruined!</p><p class="nr">The big skeleton has its hand on Lee's neck and is still biting his head. The little one is hissing again. It springs up and bites Lee's arm.  The big one grabs Lee's head for more leverage as it eats his hair.</p><p class="dia">Lee: Why do <em>stupid people</em> like what I like?! No fair! I liked them first! They sold out! Everything popular is BAD! </p>
