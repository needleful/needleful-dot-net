						<p class="nr">A giant lady is holding Lee.</p><p class="dia">Lady: Oh ho ho! I am going to eat you!</p><p class="dia">Lee: I think you should reconsider.</p><p class="dia">Lady: I disagree!</p><p class="nr">The lady is holding a frying pan.</p><p class="dia">Lee: But why eat humans? We are small and smelly. Why not eat a more nutrient-dense food, like a big school of fish, or a herd of cows?</p><p class="nr">Lee is trying to wiggle free as he talks</p><p class="dia">Lady: Oh ho ho! I don't eat humans for nutrition.</p><p class="nr">The frying pan is on the stove now, and she's pouring cooking oil into it.</p><p class="dia">Lady: I eat them because it's funny! A lady, eating people? How silly!</p><p class="dia">Lee: That is terrible logic.</p><p class="nr">He's almost free. He's halfway out of her hand, flopping down.</p><p class="dia">Lady: In you go!</p><p class="nr">She throws him in the pan with a sizzle.</p>
