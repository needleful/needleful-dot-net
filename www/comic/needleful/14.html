					<h2>Transcript</h2>
					<p class="nr">There is a little creature with big teeth, staring at you.</p><p class="dia">Narration: This is Bob, the Awful Little Man with Big Teeth. That's his given name. An odd choice. He's actually quite nice.</p><p class="nr">Bob is standing on the counter, getting a box of cereal from the cabinet.</p><p class="dia">Narration: He eats a lot of cereal and leaves the bowl behind, though.</p><p class="nr">He's pouring the cereal.</p><p class="dia">Narration: A lot of cereal.</p><p class="nr">There are several bowls already on the counter.</p><p class="dia">Serious white text on a black background, no image: I did not think something like cereal could stink, but every day I am greeted by the stench of sugary cereal soaking in warm milk, and it makes me want to vomit. He could rinse the bowl in the sink before he leaves in the morning. But he chooses, again and again, not to. I am going to kill Bob in his sleep.</p><p class="nr">Back to normal, Bob is eating some cereal.</p><p class="dia">Narration: Actually, Bob's name is very fitting.</p>
