					<p>
				The fingers of the hand think they are free.<br></br>
				The people of the land think they can see.<br></br>
				They don't know what lies beyond.<br></br></p><p>
				The photographs of eyes upon the wall.<br></br>
				She hears it in the silence, hears the call.<br></br>
				The visions of light and violence, she sees it all.<br></br>
				She don't know what lies beyond.<br></br></p><p>
				Like a box with no holes save the very smallest pin.<br></br>
				The shapes coming in are construed as good or sin.<br></br>
				There is nothing in this universe save us and empty space.<br></br>
				But go far enough the other way and you will see God's face.<br></br></p><p>
				The forms are calling out inside her dreams.<br></br>
				She sees the threads that make the seams.<br></br>
				She makes the cut and pulls.<br></br>
				She don't know what lies beyond.<br></br></p><p>
				She cannot hear nor see<br></br>
				The slice of a slice of a slice<br></br>
				Of something moving before her.<br></br></p><p>
				Something unlike matter strikes her with a force that<br></br>
				Turns her blood into cobalt and eyes into fire.<br></br>
				She becomes undone like a ragdoll in a furnace.<br></br></p><p>
				And suddenly the seams are stitched.<br></br>
				And she wakes up.<br></br>
				She don't know what lies beyond.<br></br></p>
