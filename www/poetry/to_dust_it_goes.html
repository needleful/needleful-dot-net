						<p>				The grass turns to ash beneath his feet. <br>
				That's all of him the common man will see.<br>
				These modern days, he just takes the road<br>
				As he makes his daily sweep.<br></p><p>				There are flowers laid for him<br>
				By whom he never knows.<br>
				He takes his timid lover's gift<br>
				And then to dust it goes.<br>
			</p><p>				She's lying still in bed, alone.<br>
				These are the folks he's always known.<br>
				He puts his hand upon her head<br>
				Where they go is never said.<br>
			</p><p>				He sees by her a single flower,<br>
				A pale and lonely rose.<br>
				He takes his timid lover's gift<br>
				And then to dust it goes.<br>
			</p>
