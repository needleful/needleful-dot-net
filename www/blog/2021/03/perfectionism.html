						<p>I tried to make the perfect blog post, the blog post that would expand your mind and make you see how cool and intelligent I am.</p><p>But after a week of writing, I was nearly tempted to give up entirely.  The stress was too much for my small brain.</p><p>Then I thought to myself... "what if I just make an OK blog post".</p><p>I don't have subscribers.  I don't have ad contracts.  Odds are the only person who'll see this for the next few months are friends and family.  So why not take it easy for a bit.</p><p>So this is my OK blog post.  You're welcome.</p>
