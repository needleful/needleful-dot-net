						<p class="note"> Note: Anybody who has a self-help blog <em>will</em> try to talk you into joining their MLM program at some point.  This is fact.  This is indisputable.  Thankfully this is basically my diary but public and used to market my comics, so you can read on without fear.</p><p>I've realized I'll often start on a creative project, and it'll explode in scope.  Then I'll think to myself "<i>I'm not ready to do this.  I should make something smaller first</i>".  So I'll put that project on hold and create something new.  Then the new project will explode in scope, and I'll think to myself "<i>I'm not ready to do this.  I should make something smaller</i>". This started when I was in high school, and I just kept adding more and more projects between me and what I really want to do.</p><p>This is the Project Fractal.</p><img src="/img/blog/abstract/feiganbaum_zoom_in.gif" style="margin:auto;" alt="zooming into a fractal infinitely" /><p class="caption">"All I wanted was to write Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction..."</p><p>I don't know if this is a common behavior.  I don't know if there's another term for this.  I don't know if this blog will be helpful to anyone experiencing this.  But I know I have a Project Fractal and it's gone off the rails.</p><p>A couple years ago I started developing a simple 3D platformer using Godot, because my original game idea had gotten too large.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K0mXhDUFvQo" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">whoops!</iframe><p>I decided the only way the game would work would be if it were open world.  I soon realized an open world game would be too much for one person, so I decided to make a much simpler game, just a single character sending one-way text messages. And then I decided to make it in <a href="https://github.com/needleful/lantana-engine">my own game engine</a>.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kJCsEYgr6kM" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">wombo</iframe><p>When the engine was in a working state and the game was coming along, I realized writing a game entirely about a character monologuing is quite difficult if you can't write a compelling monologue, so I dropped it and started a new game in the engine, which was basically Animal Crossing with fancy AI.</p><p>I soon realized I didn't actually know <em>how</em> to build the fancy AI I wanted (also I needed to make hundreds of animations for the various actions the characters could perform).  Inspired by a fun Sonic fangame I played, I decided to suspend this project and make a linear 3D platformer starring Sonic.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ex4PvUhACQY" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" style="margin:auto;" allowfullscreen="">This youtube embed is broken!! yikes!</iframe><p>But this game got quite complex, especially the animation logic. I decided to take a break and start on a little first person shooter.  Just an easy little thing, you know?</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YgGR2CKed74" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">This youtube embed is broken!! yikes!</iframe><p>The animation logic for this game is the most complicated animation logic I have ever developed. I even discovered some <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/46038">quirky lil' bugs</a> in Godot's animation system and had to create a custom branch of the engine to fix them.  I was in over my head, but implementing the AI for the enemies gave me insight on how to continue the Animal Crossing ripoff, so I then looped back to that.  But then I saw some Sonic fangames and was inspired to keep working on <em>that</em>.  And <em>now</em> I want to pick up the first 3D platformer again but with the gimmick that the character jumps by firing a shotgun into the ground and getting flung by recoil (original idea it is now pattented* sorry).</p><p>If I had spent the past 2 years working on any one of these projects, it may well have been completed by now.  If I had spent the time working on any one of the <em>literally dozens of games</em> I started before these, I could have finished multiple games.</p><p>But I didn't.  I made prototype after prototype, and once it got to a certain point, I found some reason to quit and start something else, usually by blowing up the scope of the game to an unreasonable scale.  What the hell am I doing?  I've spent an enormous amount of time and effort on these and have nearly nothing to show for it.</p><h2>Perfectionism</h2><p>During study hall in my sophomore year of high school, I was turning in some work to my English teacher and she asked me, "why do you always turn in your work late?"</p><p>I hadn't thought about it much before.  I always did my work at the last minute, and usually turned it in late.  I still did pretty well in school, so I didn't have a reason to worry about it.  "I don't know," I said.  "Overconfidence, I guess?"</p><p>"I don't think that's it." She said. "You want to know what I think? I think you do it because you're scared of trying as hard as you can, and then coming up short. <i>"Oh man, I only got a 97 on this paper? I worked so hard on it.."</i>  You'd rather do everything at the last minute and do worse, because then you can say <i>"oh well of course I only got a 90 or whatever, I threw this together at the last minute.  That's actually really good."</i> It gives you an out if you don't do that great. It's a way of defending yourself."</p><p>I didn't know what to make of what she said, or how to respond.  I just nodded, made a noise, and sat back down at my desk.</p><p>Everybody I've told this story to has said something along the lines of "that's a weirdly harsh thing for an English teacher to tell you".  But she wasn't just right in her assessment, she pinpointed one of my core psychological problems.</p><p>The idea that perfectionism can prevent people from finishing work is not novel.  <em>"Perfect is the enemy of good"</em> and all that.  But my English teacher was the one who introduced it to me, at 16 or so.</p><p>The Project Fractal is just another face of perfectionism.  Instead of downsizing projects, compromising, or just doing the work and making something tangible, it's much easier to work on something, imagine how great it'll be when it's done, and then drop it and work on something else.  I don't have to consider the possibility of releasing something bad if I don't release anything at all.</p><h2>Welcome to needleful dot net</h2><p>I made this site specifically to face the music, so to speak. I wanted a place where I could publically anounce anything I was making, regardless of what it was or how far along it was, and make myself commit to it.</p><p>Ironically, making this site is a microcosm of the Project Fractal.  I started on the website to avoid working on my game.  I decided to make <a href="https://github.com/needleful/npsg">my own static site generator</a> instead of just using Hugo or something.  And when I ran into issues with the generator, I started working on a total rewrite using SWI-Prolog before I realized what I was doing and made myself finish the site.</p><p class="note">* not patented, <em>pattented</em></p>
