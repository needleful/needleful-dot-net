						<p class="note"> Note: Anybody who has a self-help blog <em>will</em> try to talk you into joining their MLM program at some point.  This is fact.  This is indisputable.  Thankfully this is basically just my diary and not a self-help blog, so you can read on without fear.</p><p>I've realized I'll often start on a creative project, and it'll explode in scope.  Then I'll think to myself "<i>I'm not ready to do this.  I should make something smaller first</i>".  So I'll put that project on hold and create something new.  Then the new project will explode in scope, and I'll think to myself "<i>I'm not ready to do this.  I should make something smaller</i>". This started when I was in high school, and I just kept adding more and more projects between me and what I really want to do.</p><p>This is the Project Fractal.</p><img src="/img/blog/abstract/feiganbaum_zoom_in.gif" style="margin:auto;" alt="zooming into a fractal infinitely" /><p class="caption">"All I wanted was to write Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction..."</p><p>I don't know if this is a common behavior.  I don't know if there's another term for this.  I don't know if this blog will be helpful to anyone experiencing this.  But I know I have a Project Fractal and it's gone off the rails.</p><p>A couple years ago I started developing a simple 3D platformer using Godot, because my original game idea had gotten too large.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K0mXhDUFvQo" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">whoops!</iframe><p>I decided the only way the game would work would be if it were open world.  I soon realized an open world game would be too much for one person, so I decided to make a much simpler game, just a single character sending one-way text messages... and then I decided to make it in <a href="https://github.com/needleful/lantana-engine">my own game engine</a>.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kJCsEYgr6kM" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">Embebbed Bideo</iframe><p>When the engine was in a working state and the game was coming along, I realized writing a game entirely about a character monologuing is quite difficult if you can't write a compelling monologue, so I dropped it and started a new game in the engine, which was basically Animal Crossing with fancy AI.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DebQyz72eiw" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">wi</iframe><p>I soon realized I didn't actually know <em>how</em> to build the fancy AI I wanted (it's not even shown in the video because the scripting system decided it no longer works and I don't know what happened).  Inspired by a fun Sonic fangame I played, I decided to suspend this project and make a linear 3D platformer starring Sonic.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ex4PvUhACQY" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" style="margin:auto;" allowfullscreen="">This youtube embed is broken!! yikes!</iframe><p>But this game got quite complex, especially the animation logic. I decided to take a break and start on a little first person shooter.  Just an easy little thing, you know?</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YgGR2CKed74" frameborder="0" allow="picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">for some reason these youtube embeds only work if i write text in the tags. the other iframes on this site work just fine, but not the youtube ones for some reason</iframe><p>The animation logic for this game is the most complicated animation logic I have ever developed. I even discovered some <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/46038">quirky lil' bugs</a> in Godot's animation system and had to create a custom branch of the engine to fix them.  I was in over my head, but implementing the AI for the enemies gave me insight on how to continue the Animal Crossing ripoff, so I then looped back to that.  But then I saw some Sonic fangames and was inspired to keep working on <em>that</em>.  And <em>now</em> I want to pick up the first 3D platformer again but with the gimmick that the character jumps by firing a shotgun into the ground and getting flung by recoil (original idea it is now pattented* sorry).</p><p>This is already tedious to read, and I skipped like <em>half</em> the games I made in this time, and haven't even touched on the comics, short stories, and music I haven't completed.</p><p>If I had spent the past 2 years working on any one of these projects, it may well have been completed by now.  If I had spent the time working on any one of the <em>literally dozens of other things</em> I started, I could have a whole library of stuff to show.</p><p>But I didn't.  I made prototype after prototype, draft after draft, sketch after sketch, and once it got to a certain point, I found some reason to quit and start something else, usually by blowing up the scope of the project to an unreasonable scale.  But why?  Why do I do this to myself?  I've spent an enormous amount of time and effort working and I'm denying myself the satisfaction of completing anything.</p><h2>Oh somebody already made a blog about this</h2><p>Projects are just more fun at the start.  Going from nothing to something in a couple days feels a lot better than going from 10% of a finished project to 10.5%.</p><h2>Welcome to needleful dot net</h2><p>I made this site as a way to counter the project fractal. Specifically I made it to upload my <a href="comic/needleful">comic series</a>, which I had up on hiatus for three years to work on something else (which I never completed before going to something else, etc.). I wanted a place where I could publically anounce anything I was making, regardless of what it was or how far along it was, and make myself commit to it.</p><p>Ironically, making this site is a microcosm of the Project Fractal.  I started on the website to avoid working on my game.  I decided to make <a href="https://github.com/needleful/npsg">my own static site generator</a> instead of just using Hugo or something.  And when I ran into issues with the generator, I started working on a total rewrite using SWI-Prolog before I realized what I was doing and made myself finish the site.</p><p class="note">* not patented, <em>pattented</em></p>
