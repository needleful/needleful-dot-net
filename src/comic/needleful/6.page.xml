		<description>our daring protagonist is in a wild situation uh-oh!!</description>
		<transcript>
			<p class='nr'>A giant lady is holding Lee.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lady: Oh ho ho! I am going to eat you!</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: I think you should reconsider.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lady: I disagree!</p>

			<p class='nr'>The lady is holding a frying pan.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: But why eat humans? We are small and smelly. Why not eat a more nutrient-dense food, like a big school of fish, or a herd of cows?</p>

			<p class='nr'>Lee is trying to wiggle free as he talks</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lady: Oh ho ho! I don't eat humans for nutrition.</p>

			<p class='nr'>The frying pan is on the stove now, and she's pouring cooking oil into it.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lady: I eat them because it's funny! A lady, eating people? How silly!</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: That is terrible logic.</p>

			<p class='nr'>He's almost free. He's halfway out of her hand, flopping down.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lady: In you go!</p>

			<p class='nr'>She throws him in the pan with a sizzle.</p>
