			<p>I never really analyzed the the order in which these comics were made, but it seems obvious now that this comic was to make up for the last one.  I wanted to make something with more emotion and meaning after kind of just farting out a four-panel nothingburger.</p>
			<p>This one didn't get much reaction either.  But unlike the last one, I didn't feel upset about it.  <em>I</em> like this comic.  I still reread it and enjoy it, which is more than I can say about a lot of these.</p>

			<p class='nr'>A strange humanoid is walking up a staircase.  To its left is something that looks like a massive cable.  It's holding a hairbrush.</p>
			<p class='nr'>It stops at the top of the stairs.  The "cable" was actually a man's hair.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Man: I have been holding my breath. For twelve million years... Probably</p>
			<p class='nr'>The humanoid brushes his hair.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Man: I do not remember when exactly I stopped breathing, nor why.  I remember little of the world, save a few faint echos.  But I was there.  And I held my breath.</p>
			<p class='nr'>The man's hair is held off the ground by poles.  It's so long it goes out of the building.  All along this hair cable are those humanoids brushing the hair.</p>
			<p class='nr'>It leads on for miles.  Through a forest, across a lake, into a city.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Man: I have no use for air.  I no longer need sustenance, and the beings now ruling this world no longer use language.  At least, I don't <em>think</em> they use language.</p>
			<p class='nr'>A small sub-cable splits off from the rest of the hair and is directed into a building.  In this building there appears to be a shrine, at the center of which is a single strand of the man's hair stretched into a geometric pattern, before the strand resumes its journey in the cable.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Man: They make their clicks and rattle their heads, but I have seen no patterns.</p>
			<p class='nr'>Two of the humanoids are sitting in a savannah at the end of the hair cable.  They're assembling a new pole to pass the hair through.  One is sitting down, using tweezers to pull individual strands through a fine mesh.  </p>
			<p class='dia'>Man: They are incomprehensible... save a few echos of familiarity.</p>
			<p class='nr'>The other humanoid taps the sitting one on the head and grabs its hand.  They look at the sunset together.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Man: I love these echos so very much.</p>
