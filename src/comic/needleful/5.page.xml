			<p class='nr'>A server room. A man and a woman are walking towards something.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Woman: Something is coming through the wires.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Man: What? You mean signals? Hackers?</p>

			<p class='dia'>Woman: No. Something else. It's not electronic.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Man: I don't follow any of this. What is coming? Are we safe?</p>

			<p class='dia'>Woman: I'm sorry I'm being so vague. I'm not trying to be. It's just... We don't know anything. All we know is... Somthing is coming. And it's going to be here very, very soon.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Man: ... Have you been doing drugs again?</p>

			<p class='nr'>TOOM! The power goes out, except for a computer at the other end of the room.</p>

			<p class='nr'>The man and the woman stand still. On the computer, a hand appears in the static. It's reaching towards them. The hand breaks through the monitor, like it was emerging from water. A person, or something that looks like one, is crawling out.</p>

			<p class='nr'>The apparition raises its head and says: "I do not want your mobile app so please tell your website to stop asking me."</p>
