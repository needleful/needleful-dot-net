			<p class = 'dia'>The man: As the powerpoint shows, our membership has been declining year after year.</p>
			<p class = 'nr'>There are three men watching the presentation, all bearded men in robes. One is asleep.</p>
			<p class = 'dia'>Middle Man: We hired a recruited, didn't we? One to connect with the college-age youth?</p>
			<p class = 'nr'>It cuts to a university, where Lee is talking to a crowd of college students with a megaphone.</p>
			<p class = 'dia'>Lee: You are all gross, smelly SINNERS. Why do we have wheelchair ramps? Respecting people is a sign of weakness.</p>
			<p class = 'dia'>Someone in the crowd: <em>YOU SUCK!</em></p>
