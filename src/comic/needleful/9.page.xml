			<p class='nr'>Lee is looking out an window open.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: I love the sound of birds in the morning.</p>

			<p class='dia'>A terrible nasty crow: <em>SCRAW SCRAW SCRAW SCRAW</em></p>

			<p class='nr'>A bunch of crows are on a tree scrawing their bad noises. Crows are the worst bird and worst animal. A bird on the far end of the branch is skreeching.</p>

			<p class='nr'>We get a closeup. It has no beak, only a big mouth with teeth. It is still screeching.</p>
