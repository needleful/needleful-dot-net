			<p class='nr'>Lee and a woman are walking together.  They're dressed up nice.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: That was fun!</p>

			<p class='dia'>Girl: Yeah</p>

			<p class='nr'>The girl puts her hand on Lee's shoulder.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Girl: Hey.  One more thing.</p>

			<p class='nr'>She pulls out a knife and very slowly plunges it into lee's ribcage.  Black, oily blood comes from the wound.  Lee grimaces and stares at the girl angrily.  She's smiling gently.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Why have you done this terrible thing?</p>

			<p class='dia'>Girl: It's satire.</p>
