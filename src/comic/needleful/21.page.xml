			<p>Some people found this comic confusing, so here's some clarification: while the entity in this comic is referred to as "God", it is actually based on a dream I had where I died and this is what I looked like as an angel.  It was some sort of co-op situation where everybody was their own god.  Also my older brother Dr. Manhattan was there, and he also looked like this, and I thought that was a clever and subtle metaphor for his godlike power as depicted in the comic <i>Watchmen</i>.  And then I noclipped around my childhood home and felt true euphoria, realizing heaven was being home with my family, having all the time in the world.</p>
			<p>And then I woke up.  I go back to my old home and it's just an empty house.</p>
			<p>I wish I believed in God and heaven.  I wish I could go to sleep knowing someday I would come back home forever.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Hopefully this answers any questions about the comic.</p>

			<p class='nr'>An entity is towering hundreds of feet over Lee.  He's wearing a pitch black suit and his head is just a piece of paper with the word "God" written on it in large letters.  He is pointing at Lee.</p>

			<p class='dia,small-caps'>God: We shall play a game.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Uh... o-okay.</p>

			<p class='dia,small-caps'>God: The rules are simple.  I draw a card and you do what it says.</p>

			<p class='nr'>He pulls out a baseball card for "Mr. Baseball".</p>

			<p class='dia,small-caps'>God: This one says "Tell a funny joke about ants"</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee (distressed): Wha- but...</p>

			<p class='dia,small-caps'>God: Do it.</p>

			<p class='nr'>Lee puts his head to his forehead, trying to focus his energy on making a really good joke about ants.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Oh wowsers, uhm. So... so a uh... what did the ant, covered in- in jelly, say to- to the other ant?</p>

			<p class='dia,small-caps'>God: Ha ha ha ha!  I get it!  Ants cannot speak!!</p>

			<p class='nr'>God has his hand on his belly in a laughing fit at Lee's great joke.  He leans in close, his body so colosal only a bit of his hand and the G in his face are visible.  He's pointing at Lee again.</p>

			<p class='dia,small-caps'>God: You are very good at this game!</p>
