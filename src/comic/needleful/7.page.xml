			<p class='nr'>There is a young Lee with swooshy hair.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Today's comic is sponsored by...</p>

			<p class='nr'>He holds up a knife.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: War™</p>

			<p class='nr'>He approaches two kids, a little girl and boy, and shows them the knife.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Hello children, do you like knives™?</p>

			<p class='dia'>Both Children: Yes.</p>

			<p class='nr'>Lee hands the boy the knife.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: This knife™ sends people back in time when stabbed!</p>

			<p class='dia'>Children: Woah.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Have fun!</p>

			<p class='nr'>The children run off with the knife.</p>

			<p class='nr'>Off-panel, we hear several people being stabbed</p>

			<p class='dia'>Unknown voice: Seize the means!</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Uh-oh. The children have killed the government and established a Marxist state.</p>

			<p class='dia'>A crane is lowering a statue of a man onto an elevated base, while someone chisels on the base, directed by the boy. The girl is stabbing a dead body.</p>

			<p class='dia'>The statue is revealed to be of Karl Marx, with "PAPA" poorly carved on the base. The children are dancing and skipping around the it.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: This collaboration has gone very poorly.</p>
