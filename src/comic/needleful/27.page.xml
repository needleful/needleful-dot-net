			<p class='nr'>Lee is staring intently at an apple.  It's been set on a pillow with a lamp shining on it.  He scratches his nose.  Suddenly, the apple begins to crack.  It splits open like an apple, revealing a tiny pink lady.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Pink Lady: I am born.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Will you be my girlfriend?</p>

			<p class='dia'>Pink Lady: Creating a sentient lifeform just to trick it into being your girlfriend is exactly why you don't have a girlfriend.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: Please don't bully me.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Pink lady: lmao I most definitely will.</p>
