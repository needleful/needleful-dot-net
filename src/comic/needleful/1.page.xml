			<p class='nr'>A boy and a girl sit on the couch.  The girl is under a blanket, snuggling against the boy.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Girl: Confession time!</p>
			<p>The boy is confused</p>
			<p class='dia'>Girl: I tell <em>you</em> a secret, then you tell <em>me</em> one!</p>
			<p class='dia'>Girl: I am actually a giant <em>snake</em> in an elaborate disguise!  Aided by my snake brethren, we wish to have many snake-people babies with you, who may integrate with the humans and serve as ambassadors of our kind.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Boy: I pretend to love you because I'm scared of being alone.</p>
			<p class='nr'>The girl moves away from the boy with a sad look on her face</p>
			<p class='dia'>Girl (with a sad smile): So I... I guess we <em>both</em> are snakes... Hahaha!</p>
			<p class='dia'>Boy (akwardly): hahaha...</p>
			<p class='nr'>The girl turns into a snake and eats the boy's head.</p>
