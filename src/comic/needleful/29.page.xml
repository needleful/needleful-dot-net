			<p>Well, here it is.  The last comic.  Then I disappeared for nearly three years.  Not much of a climactic conclusion.</p>
			<p>On Tapas, I made a post saying the comic was ending because I was bored of it.  But that's a lie.  I was afraid of it.  I wasn't getting the validation and attention I was hoping for, and I was getting invested in the comic to the point it was harming my mental health.  I would spend hours just refreshing my metrics for new pages.  I would research when to post to different social media sites to maximize engagement. </p>
			<p>It wasn't healthy, but to say I quit for my health would be generous.  I was just afraid I would spend a lot of effort on something that wouldn't pay off.  But it <em>did</em> pay off.  I haven't made any money off this, but I made things I'm proud of.  I'd like to make more things I'm proud of.</p>

			<p class='nr'>Lee is making some bacon.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Unknown voice: Hey.</p>

			<p class='nr'>Lee turns around.  The voice was a little boy with an enormous revolver.  He's pointing it at Lee.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Boy: Hi.</p>

			<p class='nr'>He fires, narrowly missing Lee, who ducked down, and destroying the cabinet behind him.  He fires into the ceiling repeatedly.</p>

			<p class='dia'>Lee: <em>What is happening?!</em></p>

			<p class='dia'>Boy: Wanna play cowboys?</p>
