			<p>Just kidding about that last comic where i said it was the end!!</p>
			<p>I made this one real quick for Inktober 2022, and then I didn't do a single other comic for Inktober!</p>
			<p>It was an idea I'd been kicking around for a while, though. I still have lots of little comics in notes that I want to make.</p>
			<p>I just need to be in the right mood for it.</p>

			<p class ='nr'>An old man and a young man are standing somewhere.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Old Man: Why are your eyes closed? Such disrespect.</p>
			<p class='nr'>Both of their eyes are closed.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Young man: Because the Penance Spire cursed humanity to eternal blindness, you ancient dipshit.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Old Man: Typical millenial! Blame everyone but yourself!</p>
			<p class='dia'>Young Man: I'm a <em>zoomer</em>, boomer!</p>
			<p class='dia'>Old Man: <em>Prove it!</em></p>
			<p class='nr'>The Young Man screams and fire shoots from his eyes. Heat radiates from his body as he powers up.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Young Man: So... This is "sight".</p>
			<p class='nr'>Smoke comes from the young man's eyes as he opens them. He then immediately closes them again.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Young Man: I prefer blindness.</p>
			<p class='dia'>Old Man: Such disrespect!</p>
