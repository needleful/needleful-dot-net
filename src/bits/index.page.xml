			<p>I have some odds and ends I'm hosting on the site, specifically web programs I want to use.</p>
			<h2><a href='/bits/sheets.html'>NP Sheets</a></h2>
			<p>I made a simple spreadsheet program to do my taxes because I stopped using office and the other offerings are too slow!</p>
			<p>I made numerous errors on my taxes due to improperly calculating my tax deductions, but the software itself works just fine!</p>
			<h2><a href='/bits/wasm.html'>WASM "Compiler"</a></h2>
			<p>You can "compile" some WASM in your browser on this page. You'll see what I mean if you click.</p>
			<h2><a href="/bits/b5500/webUI/B5500Console.html">Retro-B5500</a></h2>
			<p>I put a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/pkimpel/retro-b5500">retro-b5500 emulator</a> on my site!</p>
			<p>I decided to host it because I'm learning some ALGOL in my free time and figured an authentic ALGOL system is the best place to start. Eventually I might even publish the project I'm working on!</p>
