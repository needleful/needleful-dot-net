			<p>I have a few poems in old notebooks, so I'll put them here before the notes get destroyed on accident.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/poetry/to_dust_it_goes.html">To Dust it Goes</a>. They're lyrics to a song I was writing at The Song School. It was probably 2016 or so.</li>
				<li><a href='/poetry/they_dont_know.html'>They Don't Know</a>. More lyrics from the same time as "To Dust it Goes". They're not as impressive as I remember.</li>
			</ul>
