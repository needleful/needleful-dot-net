				The fingers of the hand think they are free.<br/>
				The people of the land think they can see.<br/>
				They don't know what lies beyond.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The photographs of eyes upon the wall.<br/>
				She hears it in the silence, hears the call.<br/>
				The visions of light and violence, she sees it all.<br/>
				She don't know what lies beyond.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Like a box with no holes save the very smallest pin.<br/>
				The shapes coming in are construed as good or sin.<br/>
				There is nothing in this universe save us and empty space.<br/>
				But go far enough the other way and you will see God's face.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The forms are calling out inside her dreams.<br/>
				She sees the threads that make the seams.<br/>
				She makes the cut and pulls.<br/>
				She don't know what lies beyond.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				She cannot hear nor see<br/>
				The slice of a slice of a slice<br/>
				Of something moving before her.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Something unlike matter strikes her with a force that<br/>
				Turns her blood into cobalt and eyes into fire.<br/>
				She becomes undone like a ragdoll in a furnace.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				And suddenly the seams are stitched.<br/>
				And she wakes up.<br/>
				She don't know what lies beyond.<br/>
