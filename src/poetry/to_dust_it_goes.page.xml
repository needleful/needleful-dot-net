				The grass turns to ash beneath his feet. <br />
				That's all of him the common man will see.<br />
				These modern days, he just takes the road<br />
				As he makes his daily sweep.<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				There are flowers laid for him<br />
				By whom he never knows.<br />
				He takes his timid lover's gift<br />
				And then to dust it goes.<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				She's lying still in bed, alone.<br />
				These are the folks he's always known.<br />
				He puts his hand upon her head<br />
				Where they go is never said.<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				He sees by her a single flower,<br />
				A pale and lonely rose.<br />
				He takes his timid lover's gift<br />
				And then to dust it goes.<br />
